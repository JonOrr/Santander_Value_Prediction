# Santander_Value_Prediction
Repository constructed for the Santander Value Prediction Kaggle Competition.

The Milestone report looks into the Exploratory Data Analysis and conducts a RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for the Random Forest Regressor. 

The Final Report combines the efforts of the Milestone Report with feature engineering and LightGBM to reduce error and improve score within the kaggle competition. 

The slide deck is a presentation of the results in a format suitable for both technical and non-technical staff.
