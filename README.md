# Santander_Value_Prediction
Repository constructed for the Santander Value Prediction Kaggle Competition (My current project)

The Milestone report looks into the Exploratory Data Analysis and conducts a RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for the Random Forest Regressor. 

Notes on future inclusions:

The Final Report combines the efforts of the Milestone Report with feature engineering and LightGBM to reduce error and improve score within the kaggle competition. 

The slide deck is a presentation of the results in a format suitable for both technical and non-technical staff.
